# Execution-mode connection-consumption harness (issue #323).
#
# Runs the SAME offered workload through the threads and async execution pools
# and measures how many real Postgres connections each mode actually holds, so
# we can guide users on DB-pool sizing per execution_mode.
#
# THE HONEST FINDING this harness exists to prove/disprove: pgbus holds a pgmq
# connection only for the read/archive SQL round-trip, NOT the job body
# (executor.rb runs `perform_now` with zero pgmq connections). So async does NOT
# "save connections" by yielding mid-checkout — a fiber holds a connection for
# exactly one SQL round-trip, same as a thread. Async's only connection
# advantage is the fraction of wall time spent OUTSIDE `with_connection`
# (io_light). For DB-bound work, async is connection-bound just like threads and
# a tiny pool STARVES (surfacing as pool_timeouts). The io_profile cells prove
# which regime you're in.
#
# Pure, require-able module (no side effects on load, mirroring bench_support).
# The fairness/struct/measurement LOGIC is unit-tested with injected fakes (no
# DB); the actual numbers come from a real DB via run_cell in the bench script.
