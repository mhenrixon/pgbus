# frozen_string_literal: true

# Writer-burst gate benchmark (issue #323 phase 1 — the measure-first gate).
#
# QUESTION IT ANSWERS: under a sustained fanout burst (many connections, each
# doing a non-trivial socket write), is the WRITER POOL (streams_writer_threads)
# the throughput limiter? Issue #323 phase 1 gates the elastic-writer rewrite on
# "only if writer throughput is the confirmed bottleneck." #322 already showed 2
# writers DECOUPLE the dispatcher from slow clients (head-of-line cure); this
# bench asks the different question phase 1 hinges on: does adding MORE writer
# threads raise total fanout throughput, or does a small fixed N already keep up?
#
# HOW: register a fleet of connections, each enqueue() sleeping `write_s` (models
# a real socket write), and drive a burst of wakes through the OutboundPump with
# streams_writer_threads swept 2..16. Measure total wall time to flush the whole
# burst and the resulting throughput (frames/s). If throughput scales with writer
# count, the writer pool is a limiter -> elastic writers may be worth the (high,
# risky) rewrite. If it plateaus at a small N, static streams_writer_threads is
# the answer and elastic writers are not justified.
#
# No DB/Puma -- fake blocking writers, like streams_writer_offload_bench.
#
# Run-and-report, never a CI gate:
#   bundle exec rake bench:one[writer_burst_bench]

# READING THIS CORRECTLY — the crux for the ELASTICITY decision:
#
# Throughput scaling with writer count (~6-7x from 2->16 across every profile)
# is unsurprising: N parallel workers finish N independent blocking writes ~Nx
# faster. It says the writer pool benefits from MORE THREADS. It does NOT, by
# itself, justify ELASTIC (dynamic grow/shrink) writers, for two reasons:
#
#   1. streams_writer_threads is ALREADY a static knob. If more writers help, an
#      operator raises it — statically, safely, today. This curve argues for
#      using that knob, not for a high-risk dynamic-resize rewrite. (Same shape
#      as the phase-3 conclusion: raise the static count.)
#   2. Elasticity only pays off for a SPIKY workload where a static count is
#      wastefully high at rest. This bench runs a fixed N per cell — it cannot
#      show spikiness, so it cannot justify elasticity. And the genuinely
#      harmful case (a slow/congested client) is already SHED by the #320/#322
#      fanout deadline + mark-dead path, not absorbed by scaling writers.
#
# So the honest gate verdict is about elasticity, not about raw scaling:
# Report the 2→16 scaling PER profile so the "every profile" claim is backed by
# each profile's own number, not extrapolated from one.
