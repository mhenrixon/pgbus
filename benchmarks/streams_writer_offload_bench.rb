# Streams writer-offload benchmark (issue #321).
#
# The head-of-line fix in #320 BOUNDED each slow-client stall to
# streams_fanout_write_deadline_ms (250ms); a wake with K slow clients still
# cost ~K*deadline on the single dispatcher thread. #321 moves the durable
# fanout socket write OFF the dispatcher into a writer pool, so the dispatcher's
# per-wake time DECOUPLES from the slow-client count K.
#
# This bench measures the dispatcher's `handle_durable_wake` wall time for a
# broadcast to N fast + K slow connections, offload OFF (main behavior) vs ON.
# No DB/Puma — fake recording/blocking writers, like the other streams benches.
#
#   Scenario A (the win): wall time vs K. OFF scales with K; ON is ~flat.
#   Scenario B (zero-cost happy path): N fast, K=0, ON vs OFF throughput +
#     allocations. The ack round-trip is the only new per-op cost; retained
#     per op MUST be 0.
