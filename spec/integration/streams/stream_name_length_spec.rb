# Integration tests for the stream-name length safety net and the
# `Pgbus.stream_key` helper. These exercise the full path:
#
#   Pgbus.stream_key(...)  -> short name
#   Pgbus.stream(name)     -> constructs Stream (which calls validate_name_length!)
#   stream.broadcast(html) -> ensure_stream_queue -> queue_name(name)
#                             -> QueueNameValidator.validate!
#                             -> real PGMQ insert
#   stream.read_after      -> real PGMQ read
#
# The point is to prove the two layers (Pgbus::Streams::Stream's
# validate_name_length! and the underlying QueueNameValidator) agree on
# the budget for the real, configured queue_prefix and that the short
# digest produced by `stream_key` is actually accepted by PGMQ.
