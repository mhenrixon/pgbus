# Connection-failure recovery against a REAL PostgreSQL. Everything above the
# socket is unit-tested with fake error classes (client_spec.rb stubs a fake
# PGMQ::Errors::ConnectionError); nothing proves the real recovery path end to
# end. Here we kill backends with pg_terminate_backend and assert:
#
#   * Client#with_stale_connection_retry recovers a killed pooled socket and
#     loses no enqueued message (pgmq-ruby auto_reconnect + our backed-off retry).
#   * A ConnectionError whose text misses STALE_CONNECTION_PATTERNS propagates
#     un-retried (a saturated pool / genuinely-broken conn must not be retried).
#   * NotifyListener#reconnect! rebuilds its dedicated LISTEN connection and
#     re-LISTENs every channel after its backend is killed.
#   * A pool-timeout ConnectionError surfaces (deliberately not retried).
#
# All queue access goes through Pgbus::Client. The AR connection is used only
# as an out-of-band control channel to run pg_terminate_backend / NOTIFY, since
# killing your own backend from the same connection is not a stable test.
