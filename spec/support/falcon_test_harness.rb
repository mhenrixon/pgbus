  # on a fiber scheduler (Async), every request gets its own fiber, and
  # IO is non-blocking by default. The rack.hijack path goes through
  # protocol-rack's `Protocol::Rack::Adapter::Generic#unwrap_request`
  # which sets env["rack.hijack?"] = true and env["rack.hijack"] = proc,
  # same as Puma — so StreamApp doesn't need a different code path.
