# Loads the genuine PGMQ::Errors::* classes from the pgmq-ruby runtime

# hierarchy — not a fake Class.new(StandardError) stub that would keep passing
# even if pgmq-ruby restructured its errors and every rescue silently stopped
# matching.
module RealPgmqErrors
  # Ensure PGMQ::Errors::ConnectionError (and its siblings) are the genuine
  # classes from pgmq-ruby, then return the ConnectionError class.
  #
  # pgmq-ruby autoloads PGMQ::Errors via Zeitwerk (see the gem's pgmq.rb). A
  # plain `require "pgmq"` populates it the first time, but this suite (and
  # Pgbus::Client#initialize itself) sometimes replaces the ::PGMQ constant with
  # a bare Module.new so construction works without a live database. On a bare
  # module the Zeitwerk autoload is gone and `require` is a no-op (the feature is
  # already in $LOADED_FEATURES), leaving PGMQ::Errors undefined. So `load` the
  # errors file directly onto whatever ::PGMQ currently is — this re-executes the
  # source and re-defines the real classes regardless of prior stubbing, and is
  # cheap (a handful of one-line class definitions).
