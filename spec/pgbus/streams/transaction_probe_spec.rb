# Regression for the durable-broadcast connection leak (Zazu incident:
# fan-out spec pool exhaustion, 2026-08-05).
#
# `Stream#current_open_transaction` used to probe via
# `ActiveRecord::Base.connection`, which on Rails 7.2+ takes a STICKY,
# executor-scoped lease:
#
#   - On a thread/fiber with no prior lease (the Coalescer's flush thread,
#     any non-executor background thread), the lease is never released —
#     one AR pool connection pinned forever per thread.
#   - Inside `connection_pool.with_connection`, the sticky flag makes
#     with_connection SKIP its release at block exit, so the caller's
#     connection leaks when the thread dies.
#
# A freshly-leased connection can never carry the caller's open transaction
# anyway (transactions are per-lease), so the probe must only inspect an
# EXISTING lease: `connection_pool.active_connection?` — no checkout.
