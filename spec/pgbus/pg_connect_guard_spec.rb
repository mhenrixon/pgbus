# Architectural fitness function (issue #352). The :session GUC mode contract
# — Configuration#forward_connection_variables leaves a non-libpq :variables
# key on the connection options for the CALLER to strip and apply via
# post-connect SET — is invisible at the call site: a raw PG.connect(**opts)
# compiles, passes unit tests with clean options, and then fails in
# production with `invalid connection option "variables"`. That is exactly
# how the streamer and NotifyListener broke. This spec makes the contract
# structural: every raw PG connect outside the approved modules fails the
# build with directions to the choke point.
