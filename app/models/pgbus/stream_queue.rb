module Pgbus
  # Registry of physical PGMQ queue names that back streams (as opposed to
  # job queues). Stream and job queues share the same `#{queue_prefix}_`
  # namespace (see Configuration#queue_name), so there is no reliable way to
  # tell them apart by name alone. `ensure_stream_queue` records each stream
  # queue here on first broadcast/subscribe; consumers that iterate
  # `pgmq.meta` (the dispatcher's stream-archive prune and orphan sweep,
  # `compact_archives`, and the worker's wildcard resolution) use this
  # registry to classify a queue as a stream.
  #
  # Degrades safely: on an install that has not run the migration, the table
  # is absent — `record!` no-ops and `all_names` returns an empty set, so the
  # pre-registry behavior (streams treated as job queues by maintenance) is
  # preserved rather than raising.
  #
  # Pre-registry dormant streams (issue #366): queues created before this
  # table existed never re-broadcast, so they never call `record!`. Those
  # queues still carry the archive `a_<name>_msg_id_idx` index that only
  # `ensure_stream_queue` creates — `fingerprint_matched_names` discovers
  # them, `known_names` unions them with the registry for classification,
  # and `backfill!` (via `rake pgbus:streams:backfill_registry`) writes
  # the missing rows so the registry is complete.

    self.table_name = "pgbus_stream_queues"

    class << self
      # Inserts the physical queue name. Idempotent and cheap to call on
      # every broadcast; the caller (`ensure_stream_queue`) also memoizes
      # per-process, so the DB write happens once per stream per process.
      # Errors are swallowed — a registry hiccup must never abort a broadcast.
      # Returns true on a successful write, false when the table is absent or
      # the insert failed (so callers like `backfill!` can report accurately).
      #
      # Deliberately raw SQL rather than `upsert(unique_by:)` (issue #401):
      # Rails resolves `unique_by:` through the pool's schema cache, which
      # caches a negative `data_source_exists?` probe permanently — one wrong
      # first probe (while the table genuinely exists and the live
      # `table_exists?` guard above passes) poisons every subsequent record!
      # in the process with "No unique index found". The unique index is owned
      # by this gem's own migration, so there is nothing to resolve.
