    # own NOTIFY, and adds an `msg_id` index on the archive table that
    # PGMQ does not ship with.

    # index by default. `Client#read_after`'s replay query filters by
    # `WHERE msg_id > $1`, which becomes a sequential scan once the archive
    # grows past a few thousand rows. We add the index here, scoped to
    # stream queues only, so users with chat-history-style retention don't
    # hit a performance cliff.
