    # Fire-and-forget PG NOTIFY for ephemeral stream broadcasts. No PGMQ
    # queue is created — the payload travels via the Postgres NOTIFY channel
    # only, matching the channel naming convention that PGMQ's trigger uses:
    #   pgmq.q_<full_queue_name>.INSERT
    #
    # Subscribers already LISTEN on this channel via the Streamer's Listener.
    # When a subscriber is connected, the StreamEventDispatcher receives the
    # NOTIFY and fans out the payload. When no subscriber is connected,
    # the NOTIFY is silently discarded by Postgres — no queue, no storage,
    # no orphan tables.
    #
    # The payload is JSON-serialized into the NOTIFY's optional payload
    # parameter. Postgres caps NOTIFY payloads at < 8000 bytes; oversized
    # payloads raise a typed Pgbus::Streams::PayloadTooLarge here, at the
    # call site, instead of surfacing as a misleading
    # PGMQ::Errors::ConnectionError ("payload string too long") from deep
    # inside the driver (issue #391). Callers needing large payloads should
    # use durable mode (which inserts into PGMQ).
