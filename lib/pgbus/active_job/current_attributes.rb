    #
    # * +serialize+ snapshots the persisted Current classes
    #   (Pgbus::CurrentAttributes.capture) under +pgbus_current+. A job that
    #   was itself deserialized re-serializes the context it was enqueued
    #   with — so a +retry_on+ re-enqueue keeps the original context even if
    #   Current changed during the attempt. Nothing is added when the feature
    #   is off or no attribute is assigned: the payload is byte-for-byte what
    #   it was before this mixin existed.
    # * +perform_now+ is wrapped (not an +around_perform+) so the restored
    #   context also covers +rescue_from+ / +retry_on+ / +discard_on+ blocks,
    #   which run in +perform_now+'s rescue outside the perform callbacks —
    #   and it works identically under the pgbus worker, Rails' :test and
    #   :inline adapters, and a bare +job.perform_now+.
    #
    # Per-class control: +self.pgbus_persist_current_attributes = false+
    # (never persist for this job class) or a spec in the same shapes as
    # +config.current_attributes+ (an Array / Hash) to replace the config's
    # list for this class. +nil+ (default) follows the config.
