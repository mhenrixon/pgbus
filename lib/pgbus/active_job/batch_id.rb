    # Gives every ActiveJob a handle on the batch it belongs to.
    #
    # Two distinct ids, mirroring solid_queue's ActiveJob::BatchId:
    #
    # * +batch_id+ — the batch this job is a *member* of. Assigned by the
    #   executor from the payload's +pgbus_batch_id+ before +perform+, so a
    #   running job can call +batch.enqueue+ to add siblings.
    # * +callback_batch_id+ — the batch this job *reports on*. Set on
    #   +on_finish+/+on_success+/+on_failure+ jobs at fire time. A callback is
    #   never a member of the batch it reports on, so its +batch_id+ is nil.
    #
    # Both round-trip through +serialize+/+deserialize+, and both are omitted
    # from the serialized hash when unset — an unbatched job's payload is
    # byte-for-byte what it was before this mixin existed.
