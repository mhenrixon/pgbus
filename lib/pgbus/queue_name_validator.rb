module Pgbus
  # Validates and sanitizes PGMQ queue names for safe use in SQL identifiers.
  #
  # PGMQ queue names are interpolated into SQL as table/sequence names
  # (e.g., pgmq.q_<name>, pgmq.a_<name>). This module enforces strict
  # validation to prevent SQL injection via crafted queue names.
  module QueueNameValidator
    # PostgreSQL's NAMEDATALEN caps identifiers at 63 bytes, but the
    # effective limit is tighter: pgmq-ruby (our transport gem) rejects
    # any queue name with `length >= 48` in `PGMQ::Client#validate_queue_name!`.
    # That leaves an actual usable ceiling of 47 characters for the
    # fully-prefixed name (`<queue_prefix>_<logical_name>`), which is what
    # this constant expresses. pgmq-ruby picked 48 to leave headroom for
    # PGMQ's internal tables (`pgmq.q_`, `pgmq.a_`, sequences, indexes)
    # which all get suffixed beyond the base name.
    #
    # Historically this was 61 (the raw PostgreSQL ceiling minus PGMQ's
    # `q_`/`a_` prefix). That was wrong in practice: names in the 48-61
    # range passed pgbus's validator but blew up deep inside pgmq-ruby
    # with an InvalidQueueNameError — exactly the kind of opaque failure
    # the validator was meant to catch up front.
