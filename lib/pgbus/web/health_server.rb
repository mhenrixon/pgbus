    # Standalone HTTP health server for the supervisor process. When
    # `config.health_port` is set, Supervisor#run starts one of these so a
    # Kubernetes kubelet can probe the supervisor directly — the process that
    # forks and watches workers — without the supervisor having to boot Rails,
    # Puma, or the dashboard.
    #
    # It is intentionally tiny: one accept-loop thread over a TCPServer that
    # reads only the HTTP request line (`GET /readyz HTTP/1.1`), synthesizes a
    # minimal Rack env, and hands it to {HealthApp#call}. All routing and the
    # OK/DEGRADED/STALLED → status mapping live in HealthApp, so the mounted-in-
    # Rails path and this standalone path share exactly one implementation.
    #
    # This is a health probe surface, not a general HTTP server: it speaks just
    # enough HTTP/1.0 to answer a kubelet. It only parses the request line
    # (method + path), ignores headers and body, and closes the connection
    # after each response (no keep-alive).
