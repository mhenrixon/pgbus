      # stream channel currently serving at least one SSE subscriber. On
      # NOTIFY, posts a WakeMessage into the dispatch queue; the Dispatcher
      # thread does the actual read_after + fanout.
      #
      # Threading:
      #   - #start spawns ONE listener thread
      #   - ensure_listening / remove_listening are called from the
      #     dispatcher thread, which means the listener thread itself is
      #     only running `wait_for_notify` — all LISTEN/UNLISTEN SQL goes
      #     through a command queue that the listener thread drains between
      #     notifies
      #   - #stop clears @running and joins; it never touches the connection
      #   - the connection is SINGLE-OWNER: the listener thread is the only
      #     thread that may exec, wait, or close on it, from construction
      #     through teardown. PG::Connection is not thread-safe and #close is
      #     PQfinish — freeing the PGconn under a concurrent libpq call is a
      #     process-killing SEGV, not a rescuable PG::Error (issue #375)
      #
      # Health check: `wait_for_notify(timeout)` returns nil on timeout. When
      # it does, the listener runs `SELECT 1` as a TCP keepalive. If that
      # raises, the listener rebuilds a FRESH connection via connection_factory
      # and re-LISTENs every channel in `@listening_to`. This is the fix for
      # design doc §11 #1 (silently dropped LISTEN connections from NAT / PG
      # restart / network blips) — a fresh connect also re-resolves DNS and
      # converges on the promoted primary after a failover.
