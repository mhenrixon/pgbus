      # Off-thread durable-stream fanout writer (issue #321).
      #
      # The dispatcher must never block on a slow client's socket write. When
      # streams_writer_threads > 0, StreamEventDispatcher#handle_durable_wake
      # hands each (connection, filtered envelopes, batch_max) to this pump
      # instead of writing inline. The pump owns N worker threads; each
      # connection is pinned to ONE worker by `id.hash % N`, so a connection's
      # frames stay strictly ordered and its per-io mutex is never contended
      # across workers.
      #
      # The pump calls the UNCHANGED Connection#enqueue on a worker thread (the
      # blocking write, last_msg_id_sent advance, and mark_dead! all move off
      # the dispatcher), then reports back:
      #   - success  → a WriteAckMessage(connection, accepted_max) onto ack_queue.
      #                accepted_max is the highest msg_id actually written (or
      #                the batch_max for a fully-filtered empty batch, so the
      #                dispatcher's scan cursor still advances past the hidden
      #                window). The dispatcher — the SOLE owner of @scanned_cursor
      #                — applies it on its own thread. This keeps the lockless
      #                single-owner invariant intact: the writer only reports a
      #                value, it never mutates dispatcher state.
      #   - failure  → the injected on_dead callback (which posts a
      #                DisconnectMessage), NOT an ack. A failed write must never
      #                advance the cursor past a frame that never reached the
      #                socket (issue #321 B2). The dispatcher then scrubs the
      #                connection's state deterministically (B4), even on an
      #                otherwise-quiet stream.
      #
      # EPHEMERAL frames are NEVER routed here — they have no archive to replay,
      # so an async drop would be unrecoverable (issue #321 B1). #post raises
      # ArgumentError on a negative msg_id as a defense-in-depth guard against a
      # future refactor accidentally offloading one.
