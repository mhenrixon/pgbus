      # The single-threaded consumer of the shared dispatch_queue. Drains
      # three kinds of messages:
      #
      #   - Listener::WakeMessage(queue_name:) — a NOTIFY fired; read_after
      #     the minimum cursor and fan out to every connection on the stream
      #     (both registered and in-flight connects).
      #
      #   - ConnectMessage(connection:) — a new SSE client connected. Runs
      #     the 5-step race-free replay sequence from design doc §6.5:
      #       1. ensure_listening on the stream (so future WakeMessages
      #          deliver to the in-flight buffer)
      #       2. register an in-flight buffer keyed by connection
      #       3. read_after(connection.since_id) + enqueue to connection
      #       4. drain the in-flight buffer into the connection (dedup is
      #          handled by Connection#enqueue's cursor check)
      #       5. move the connection from in-flight to the main Registry
      #
      #   - DisconnectMessage(connection:) — unregister and, if the stream
      #     now has zero subscribers, eventually unlisten (lazy GC,
      #     implemented in the Streamer sweep rather than here).
      #
      # All state ownership lives on this one thread: the registry is
      # thread-safe (Phase 2.1) but the in-flight buffers are local to
      # the dispatcher and accessed only from this thread, so no locks.
      #

        #                    receive the echo of its own broadcast)
