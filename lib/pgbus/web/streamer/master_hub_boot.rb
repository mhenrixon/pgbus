      # Deferred MasterHub startup for the Puma master (issue #382). The
      # pgbus_streams plugin's `start` runs BEFORE `preload_app!` loads the
      # Rails app (and with it the pgbus initializer), so the hub cannot be
      # built eagerly. This class splits the two halves:
      #
      #   1. The socket path is exported to ENV IMMEDIATELY — workers inherit
      #      it across fork and connect lazily on first SSE use.
      #   2. A poller thread waits for Pgbus.configuration to become ready
      #      (the initializer has run — with preload_app!, before the first
      #      fork), then builds and starts the MasterHub. Workers that race a
      #      still-booting hub simply fail to connect and fall back to their
      #      own listener until they recycle — degraded footprint, never
      #      degraded semantics.
      #
      # Without preload_app! the master never loads the app, the deadline
      # expires quietly, no socket is ever bound, and every worker keeps
      # today's per-worker listener — :master scope effectively requires
      # preload_app!, documented on the docs site.
