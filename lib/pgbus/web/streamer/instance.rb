      # Lifecycle:
      #   Instance.new(...)  — allocates wiring, does NOT start threads
      #   #start             — spawns listener/dispatcher/heartbeat in order
      #   #register(conn)    — enqueues a ConnectMessage into the dispatch queue
      #   #shutdown!         — sends shutdown sentinel to every connection and
      #                        stops all threads in reverse order
      #
      # Dependency injection: every collaborator is constructor-injected so
      # tests can swap in fakes without touching Pgbus.configuration. In
      # production the module-level Streamer.current(...) builds all of the
      # defaults from the configuration.
