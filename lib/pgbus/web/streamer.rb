    # The worker-local coordinator that owns SSE connections, one PG LISTEN
    # session, and the dispatch/heartbeat threads. Lazily created on the
    # first SSE connection to a Puma worker (or eagerly in tests). There is
    # exactly one Instance per Puma worker process; the module-level
    # accessors memoise it.
    #
    # This is NOT a Singleton in the GoF sense — tests are free to construct
    # throwaway Instances directly and dependency-inject everything. The
    # `current` / `reset!` helpers exist purely so the Rack StreamApp can
    # share an instance across requests within a worker without passing it
    # through every method call.

      # Module-level mutex protecting `@current`. Without this, two
      # concurrent first-callers inside a multi-threaded Puma worker
      # can both build and start an Instance, leaking listener,
      # dispatcher, and heartbeat threads plus a PG connection. Same
      # gap would let `reset!` overlap teardown with a fresh
      # replacement instance.
