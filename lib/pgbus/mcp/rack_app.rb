module Pgbus
  module MCP
    # A turnkey, gated Rack app that serves the read-only pgbus diagnostic MCP
    # server over HTTP. Mount it inside your existing Rails app — no second
    # process, same DB credentials, same connection pool:
    #
    #   # config/routes.rb
    #   mount Pgbus::MCP.rack_app(token: ENV["PGBUS_MCP_TOKEN"]) => "/pgbus/mcp"
    #
    # The underlying transport runs in stateless + JSON-response mode, which:
    #   * makes every request a self-contained POST returning a single JSON
    #     object (no in-memory session, no SSE stream, no reaper thread), so it
    #     is safe behind multiple Puma/Falcon workers — any worker can answer
    #     any request;
    #   * is exactly what a read-only diagnostic server needs (it never pushes
    #     server-initiated messages to the client).
    #
    # Security: requests are rejected with 401 unless they carry the configured
    # token (or pass the supplied auth callable). Run it on an internal network
    # / behind your VPN, never internet-exposed.
    #
    # DNS-rebinding protection: since mcp 0.23 the transport validates the Host
    # header (loopback only, by default) and the Origin header (same-origin
    # only). That defends a server bound to localhost against a browser page
    # whose DNS name was re-pointed at 127.0.0.1 — a page that can carry no
    # bearer token, because the secret never reaches the attacker's origin. So
    # when this app is gated (+token+ or +auth+) the check is redundant, and
    # left on it rejects every request to a real hostname
    # (https://app.example.com/pgbus/mcp → 403 "Invalid Host header"). The
    # default therefore follows the gate: off when gated, on when unauthenticated.
    # Override with +dns_rebinding_protection:+, and widen the accepted hosts /
    # origins with +allowed_hosts:+ / +allowed_origins:+ when the check is on.
