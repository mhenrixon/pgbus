      # Broadcasts a Turbo Stream HTML payload through the pgbus streamer.

      # Callers pass a plain HTML string; the wrapping is an implementation
      # detail.
      #
      # Transactional semantics: if this call is made inside an open
      # ActiveRecord transaction, the PGMQ insert is deferred to an
      # after_commit callback. If the transaction rolls back, the broadcast
      # silently drops — clients never see the change that the database
      # never persisted. This is the feature no other Rails real-time stack
      # (including turbo-rails over ActionCable) can offer: the broadcast
      # and the data mutation are atomic with respect to each other.
      # Returns the assigned msg_id when sent synchronously, nil when
      # deferred (the id isn't known until the after_commit callback runs).
      #
      # Audience filtering: pass `visible_to:` with a filter label (a
      # Symbol previously registered via Pgbus::Streams.filters.register)
      # to restrict delivery to connections whose authorize-hook context
      # satisfies the predicate. The label travels with the broadcast
      # through PGMQ; the predicate itself lives in-process on the
      # subscriber side and is evaluated per-connection by the Dispatcher.
      # Per-broadcast `durable:` overrides the stream-level default for a
      # single broadcast. `nil` (the default) defers to the stream's own
      # `durable?` setting; `true`/`false` flip the mode for this call only.
      #
      # Actor-echo suppression: pass `exclude:` with the broadcaster's own
      # SSE connection id (surfaced to the page as
      # `<meta name="pgbus-connection-id">` / the element's `connection-id`
      # attribute, sent back on the action request as the
      # `X-Pgbus-Connection` header). The dispatcher skips delivery to that
      # one connection, so the actor doesn't receive the echo of its own
      # broadcast — it already applied the change via the action's HTTP
      # response. Everyone else gets the broadcast. A nil/blank `exclude`
      # is a no-op (the common path).
      # Typed SSE event name: pass `event:` to set the SSE `event:` field
      # on the delivered frame (e.g. `event: "presence"`, `event:
      # "reactive"`) while keeping the payload a Turbo Stream. Clients that
      # care can route on the typed event without sniffing the HTML;
      # default consumers still receive the standard turbo-stream/`message`
      # path. The default (`nil` or `"turbo-stream"`) is not carried on the
      # wire — it's the implicit default the dispatcher applies.
      # High-frequency coalescing: pass `coalesce:` (a window in milliseconds,
      # or `true` for the default window) together with `target:` to batch
      # rapid broadcasts to the same (stream, target) and publish only the
      # latest within the window. Superseded frames never reach the bus.
      # Last-write-wins, so this is only safe for idempotent replace/update
      # of a stable target (the high-frequency case: cursors, typing,
