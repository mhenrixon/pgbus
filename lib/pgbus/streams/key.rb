    # Short, pgbus-safe stream identifiers.
    #
    # PGMQ queue names are bounded by two ceilings: PostgreSQL's
    # NAMEDATALEN (63 chars for `pgmq.q_<name>`) and pgmq-ruby's own
    # stricter runtime check (`length >= 48` in
    # `PGMQ::Client#validate_queue_name!`). The effective budget is the
    # lower of the two, exposed as `QueueNameValidator::MAX_QUEUE_NAME_LENGTH`
    # (currently 47). Any stream name composed from UUID primary keys
    # and turbo-rails-style dom ids blows past that budget almost
    # immediately:
    #
    #     "gid://app/Ai::Chat/9c14e8b2-94c3-4c6f-8ca1-f50d2f5e22ca:messages"
    #     # => 63 chars, already too long before the "pgbus_" prefix is added.
    #
    # `stream_key` produces a deterministic short form suitable as a
    # pgbus stream identifier. It normalizes each part, joins with ":",
    # and enforces the queue-name budget (derived from the configured
    # `queue_prefix`) at the call site — raising ArgumentError rather
    # than letting the failure surface as an opaque QueueNameValidator
    # error deep inside `Pgbus.stream(...).broadcast(...)`.
    #
    # Silent truncation is intentionally NOT supported: trimming a
    # too-long key to fit would reintroduce the collision risk that the
    # 64-bit digest is chosen to eliminate. Callers who overflow should
    # shorten their own identifiers or adopt `Pgbus::Streams::Streamable`
    # on their ActiveRecord models.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #     Pgbus.stream_key(chat, :messages)
    #       # => "ai_chat_3a4f9c21b7d20e18:messages"
    #
    #     Pgbus.stream_key([user, :notifications])
    #       # => "user_5fa83c91d44a2701:notifications"
    #
    #     Pgbus.stream(Pgbus.stream_key(chat, :messages)).broadcast("<turbo-stream/>")
    #
    # Collision horizon: the 64-bit SHA-256 prefix gives a birthday bound
    # of roughly 5 billion records per model class before a 50% chance of
    # collision. For multi-tenant apps where a collision would mean two
    # records share a stream (and receive each other's broadcasts), this
    # is wide enough in practice. Callers with higher sensitivity can
    # pass `digest_bits: 128`.
