    # Encodes Server-Sent Events frames per https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html.
    #
    # Pgbus uses three frame types:
    #   - `message(id:, event:, data:)` — a real broadcast (carries an `id:` so the client
    #     can resume via `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect)
    #   - `comment(text)` — a heartbeat or sentinel that the SSE parser ignores
    #   - `retry_directive(ms)` — tells `EventSource` how long to wait before reconnecting
    #
    # All frames end with `\n\n` (the SSE event terminator). A multiline payload is
    # framed as consecutive `data:` lines (issue #392) — the client rejoins them with
    # `\n`, so delivery is lossless. `\r\n` and lone `\r` are also SSE line terminators,
    # so they become `data:` line breaks too (rejoined as `\n`; SSE cannot represent a
    # raw `\r`). Every payload line carries the `data: ` prefix, so a crafted payload
    # cannot inject forged id:/event: fields. Single-line fields (`event:`, comments)
    # still strip newlines — there a `\r`/`\n` would terminate the field early and
    # permit SSE field injection.
