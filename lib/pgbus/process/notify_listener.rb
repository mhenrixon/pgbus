    # Owns a single dedicated PG::Connection that LISTENs on the INSERT NOTIFY
    # channel of every queue a Worker/Consumer reads, and fires a WakeSignal the
    # moment any of them receives a row. This converts the worker/consumer loop
    # from "blind-read every polling_interval" into "sleep until a real insert,
    # poll only as a fallback" — eliminating the empty-read storm that dominates
    # DB load on idle queues.
    #
    # pgmq-ruby's `wait_for_notify(queue, timeout:)` is single-queue and wraps
    # the wait in `with_connection`, which only watches one channel and holds the
    # pooled connection for the whole wait. Neither fits a worker that reads N
    # queues on a small shared pool. So we own ONE raw PG::Connection and
    # hand-roll per-channel LISTEN on it.
    #
    # A persistent LISTEN connection silently dies under a transaction-pool
    # PgBouncer (LISTEN does not survive COMMIT boundaries). Point this
    # connection at a DIRECT port via `config.worker_notify_*` overrides.
    # The health-check-on-timeout catches a connection killed out from under us
    # and re-LISTENs everything.
    #
    # NOTIFY channel naming (pgmq trigger): PG_NOTIFY('pgmq.' || table || '.' ||
    # TG_OP). For queue `pgbus_default` the table is `q_pgbus_default`, so the
    # channel is `pgmq.q_pgbus_default.INSERT`.
    #
    # Thread safety: @running, @conn, and @listening_to are guarded by
    # @state_mutex. The listener thread owns @conn during wait_for_notify (a
    # blocking IO call where the mutex MUST NOT be held), so wait_once reads
    # the connection out of the mutex first and operates on a local. Reconnect
    # publishes the new connection + channel set under the mutex.
    #
    # The mutex only makes the ivar READ safe. PG::Connection itself is not
    # thread-safe, so the connection is single-owner: the listener thread is
    # the ONLY thread that may exec, wait, or close on it, from build through
    # teardown. #stop signals by clearing @running and joining — it never
    # touches the connection, because #close is PQfinish and freeing the
    # PGconn under a concurrent libpq call is a process-killing SEGV, not a
    # rescuable PG::Error (issue #375).
