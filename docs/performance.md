# Performance

Pgbus aims to be fast in the places that run on every job: the enqueue path
(`Client#send_message`), the dequeue path (`Client#read_batch`), and the
execution path (`Executor#execute`). This page documents how those paths are
kept fast, how to measure them yourself, and how performance is part of every
change.

The honest summary: **the gem overhead (serialization, queue routing, stats) is
what we control; the PGMQ round-trip and database I/O dominate end-to-end
latency.** So the unit benchmarks isolate gem overhead with a mocked PGMQ
client, while the integration benchmarks (when available) measure the full
stack. Measure before you optimize; the harness below exists so you never have
to guess.

## The hot paths

| Path | When it runs | Bench |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `Client#send_message` / `#send_batch` | every job enqueue | `client_bench.rb` |
| `Client#read_batch` | every worker poll cycle | `client_bench.rb` |
| `Executor#execute` | every job execution (deserialize + dispatch + archive) | `executor_bench.rb` |
| JSON serialization | every enqueue/dequeue (payload encoding) | `serialization_bench.rb` |
| Connection pool checkout | every PGMQ operation under concurrency | `connection_pool_bench.rb` |
| Execution pool dispatch | every job dispatched to thread/async pool | `execution_pool_bench.rb` |
| SSE streaming | every Turbo Stream broadcast | `streams_bench.rb` |
| Streamer replay read | every durable-stream wake + SSE connect (`Client#read_after`) | `streams_read_pool_bench.rb` |

## Measuring

Everything is driven from `rake`:

```bash
rake bench              # the unit benchmark suite (alias for bench:all)
rake bench:all          # serialization, client, executor — saves report to tmp/benchmarks/
rake bench:one[name]    # a single benchmark by name (e.g. client_bench)
rake bench:memory       # detailed memory profiling with allocation breakdown
rake bench:integration  # real PostgreSQL + PGMQ (requires PGBUS_DATABASE_URL)
rake bench:streams      # real Puma + SSE fan-out (requires PGBUS_DATABASE_URL)
rake bench:one[streams_read_pool_bench]  # streamer replay-read pool (requires PGBUS_DATABASE_URL)
```

- **Unit benches** (`benchmarks/*_bench.rb`) isolate gem overhead with a mocked
  PGMQ client using [`benchmark-ips`](https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips)
  (throughput) and [`memory_profiler`](https://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler)
  (allocations).
- **Integration benches** (`benchmarks/integration_bench.rb`) hit a real
  PostgreSQL + PGMQ instance for end-to-end latency.
- **Streams benches** (`benchmarks/streams_bench.rb`) boot a real Puma server
  and measure SSE broadcast fan-out.
- **Streamer replay-read bench** (`benchmarks/streams_read_pool_bench.rb`)
  isolates the per-wake `Client#read_after` cost against a real DB, comparing
  a fresh `PG.connect` per call (the pre-#315 `with_raw_connection` behavior) to
  the dedicated streams pool.

### Streamer connection model (issue #315)

The durable-stream publish and replay hot paths run on a **dedicated streams
DB pool** (`config.streams_pool_size` / `streams_pool_timeout`), separate from
the job pool (`pool_size`):

- `Client#send_stream_message` (the broadcast INSERT) draws from the streams
  pool, so a saturated job pool can't delay a broadcast on pool checkout.
- The dispatcher's per-wake reads (`read_after`, `stream_current_msg_id`,
  `stream_oldest_msg_id`) check out a persistent pooled connection via
  `Client#with_streams_connection` instead of a fresh `PG.connect` per call —
  measured ~23× faster per read against a real DB (191 μs vs 4.42 ms), removing
  the TCP + auth + TLS setup cost from the single dispatcher thread. This is a
  connection-setup win at the client layer, **not** end-to-end broadcast
  latency (which the PGMQ round-trip + LISTEN/NOTIFY + socket write dominate).

On the shared-ActiveRecord (Proc) connection path no separate pool is created
(libpq isn't thread-safe): streams share the single serialized connection, so
the isolation applies only to the dedicated `database_url` / `connection_params`
config.

**Capacity planning:** on the dedicated path this streams pool is *in addition*
to the job pool, and every forked process (worker, dispatcher, scheduler,
consumer) builds its own — even `--workers-only` processes that rarely stream.
Both pools are lazy, so an idle process holds few real connections, but when
sizing Postgres/PgBouncer `max_connections`, budget `pool_size (or the
auto-tuned resolved size) + streams_pool_size` per process rather than
`pool_size` alone.

### Reading the output

`benchmark-ips` reports **i/s** (iterations per second — higher is better).
`memory_profiler` reports **objects/bytes allocated** (transient GC pressure) and
**retained** (objects that survive — a steady climb here is a leak). For a
`send_message` call, *retained should be 0*; non-zero retained is the smell the
allocation budget specs catch.

### Measure BEFORE you change

The first rule: capture the baseline **before** touching code, or you can't
claim a delta. The cleanest way is an isolated worktree so `main` and your
branch run the *same script* on the *same machine*:

```bash
git worktree add --detach /tmp/pgbus-baseline main
cp -r benchmarks /tmp/pgbus-baseline/ && cp Gemfile Rakefile /tmp/pgbus-baseline/
(cd /tmp/pgbus-baseline && bundle install --quiet && bundle exec rake bench:all) > /tmp/before.txt
bundle exec rake bench:all > /tmp/after.txt
diff /tmp/before.txt /tmp/after.txt
git worktree remove --force /tmp/pgbus-baseline
```

There is no committed baseline file (shared CI runners are too noisy for a hard
regression gate), which is exactly why the before/after has to be a deliberate
same-machine measurement, not a comparison against a number from another box.

## Allocation budgets

The spec suite includes allocation budget tests (`spec/pgbus/allocation_budget_spec.rb`)
that enforce hard limits:

| Operation | Budget |
|-----------|--------|
| `Client#send_message` | < 50 objects/call |
| `Client#send_batch` (per item) | < 25 objects/item |
| `Client#read_batch` | < 30 objects/call |
| JSON round-trip | < 20 objects |
| Retained objects (leak detection) | 0 across 100 cycles |

These run as part of `bundle exec rspec` on every PR. They are hard gates — a
regression that exceeds the budget fails the build.

## CI

The `bench` job in `.github/workflows/main.yml` runs the unit benchmark suite
on every PR and **uploads the report as the `benchmarks` artifact**. It is
**run-and-report, never a hard fail** — it surfaces trends, it does not gate
merges on a flaky threshold. Download the artifact from the PR's checks tab to
see the numbers for that branch.

The allocation budget specs in the `test` job ARE a hard gate — those fail the
build if allocations regress past the budget.

## Adding a benchmark

A new hot path gets a new `benchmarks/<name>_bench.rb`. Use the shared harness:

```ruby
require_relative "bench_helper"

BenchSupport.header("my hot path")
BenchSupport.ips { |x| x.report("thing") { thing_under_test } }
BenchSupport.allocations("thing") { thing_under_test }
```

For unit-level benches that should run in CI, add the filename to the
`unit_benches` list in the `Rakefile`'s `bench` namespace.
