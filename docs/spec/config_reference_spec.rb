# The Configuration reference page is generated from ConfigReference::GROUPS.
# This spec keeps that data honest against the REAL Pgbus::Configuration, in both
# directions, so the reference can't silently drift from the gem:
#
#   1. Every documented option must be a real public writer accessor.
#   2. Every real writer accessor must be either documented or explicitly
#      allowlisted as internal — so a NEW config option fails the build until
#      someone documents it (or marks it internal on purpose).
